## Welcome to the Book Nook!

This is an app designed to demonstrate knowledge of Rails as an API, as well as vanilla Javascript. The book data is seeded from Google Books API.

Feel free to get cozy and let the Book Nook pick out some books for you at https://book-nook.netlify.app/. (Please be patient - it may need a few refreshes for the server side to boot up and display the books!)
